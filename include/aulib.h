/*!
 * \brief Initializes the audio system.
 *
 * \param freq
 *  Sample rate that the audio device should be opened in. The sample rate that gets actually used
 *  might change though if the device does not support the requested rate. Use \ref sampleRate() to
 *  find out the actual sample rate.
 *
 * \param format
 *  Audio sample format. The most common format is AUDIO_S16SYS. The formats are defined by SDL
 *  (SDL_audio.h). The actual format we end up using might be different than the one we request if
 *  the audio device does not support it. Use \ref sampleFormat() to find out the actual sample
 *  format.
 *
 * \param channels
 *  Amount of output channels to use. Can either be 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo.) Lower or higher values
 *  will be adjusted. Unlike the other parameters, the channel count is enforced and will not
 *  change.
 *
 * \param frameSize
 *  Size in frames (samples per channel) of the internal buffer that is used to feed audio samples
 *  to SDL. Lower values provide lower latency on audio operations, at the cost of increased CPU
 *  usage and risk of audio drop-outs. A good value for 44.1kHz output for music players is 8192
 *  bytes (8kB), while a game that needs to play sound effects without much latency would use
 *  something like 2048 instead. The actual frame size we end up using might be different. This
 *  depends on the audio device and output driver used by SDL. Use \ref frameSize() to find out the
 *  actual frame size.
 *
 * \param device
 *  A UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName() or a driver-specific name as appropriate.
 *  `nullptr` requests the most reasonable default device.
 *
 * \return
 *  \retval true The audio system was initialized successfully.
 *  \retval false The audio system could not be initialized.
