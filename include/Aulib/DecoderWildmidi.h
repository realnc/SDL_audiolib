     *  WildMIDI with.

     * \param rate
     *  Internal WildMIDI sampling rate in Hz. Must be between 11025 and 65000.

     * \param hqResampling
     *  Pass the WM_MO_ENHANCED_RESAMPLING flag to WildMIDI. By default libWildMidi uses linear
     *  interpolation for the resampling of the sound samples. Setting this option enables the
     *  library to use a resampling method that attempts to fill in the gaps giving richer sound.
     *
     * \param reverb
     *  Pass the WM_MO_REVERB flag to WildMIDI. libWildMidi has an 8 reflection reverb engine. Use
     *  this option to give more depth to the output.
     *
     * \return
     *  \retval true WildMIDI was initialized sucessfully.
     *  \retval false WildMIDI could not be initialized.
