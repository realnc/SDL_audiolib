/*!
 * \brief SDL_AudioStream resampler.
 *
 * This uses the built-in resampling functionality of SDL (through the SDL_AudioStream API) and has
 * no external dependencies. Requires at least SDL 2.0.7. Note that SDL can be built to use
 * libsamplerate instead of its own resampler. There's no way to detect whether this is the case or
 * not.
 *
 * It usually makes no sense to use this resampler, unless you have a specific need to use SDL's
 * resampler and you know that the SDL version you're running on was not built with libsamplerate
 * support. If you do want libsamplerate, then you can just use \ref Aulib::ResamplerSrc instead.
