     * \brief SRC resampler quality.
     *
     * These represent the five SRC resampling methods, with "Linear" and
     * "ZeroOrderHold" being the fastest but lowest quality, and "SincBest" the
     * slowest but highest quality.
     *
     * From [SRC's API documentation](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/api_misc.html):
     *
     * - SincBest
     *   This is a bandlimited interpolator derived from the mathematical sinc
     *   function and this is the highest quality sinc based converter,
     *   providing a worst case Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 97 decibels (dB)
     *   at a bandwidth of 97%. All three Sinc* converters are based on the
     *   techniques of Julius O. Smith although this code was developed
     *   independantly.
     *
     * - SincMedium
     *   This is another bandlimited interpolator much like the previous one.
     *   It has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 90%. The speed of the
     *   conversion is much faster than the previous one.
     *
     * - SincFastest
     *   This is the fastest bandlimited interpolator and has an SNR of 97dB
     *   and a bandwidth of 80%.
     *
     * - ZeroOrderHold
     *   A Zero Order Hold converter (interpolated value is equal to the last
     *   value). The quality is poor but the conversion speed is blindlingly
     *   fast.
     *
     * - Linear
     *   A linear converter. Again the quality is poor, but the conversion
     *   speed is blindingly fast.
